  "description": "Nymeris is a memory-game that uses audio-sequences. The game randomizes a key (1-9 + 0) and tone for 10 platforms, then emits the sequence starting with the first tone, then second tone, etc. Press the number below a platform to play that tone (you can also click on them using the mouse). Some tones in the sequence may be repeated 2x or 3x times.",
